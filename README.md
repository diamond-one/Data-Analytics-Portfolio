# My Past Data Projects

## [CG TV Series Production Pipeline Optimization](https://github.com/diamond-one/CG-TV-Series-Pipeline-Optimisation/tree/main)
In this project, I optimized the production pipeline for the CG animated TV series "Muppet Babies" by analyzing data from the lighting and rendering departments. We identified critical bottlenecks in Shading and Rigging, implemented specialized review stages, and enhanced QA processes for early issue detection. 

---

## [Animation Studio Velocity Analysis](https://github.com/diamond-one/Animation-Studio-Velocity-Analysis)
This project analyzed output disparities across animation studios, focusing on production speed and efficiency. By comparing different studios, we identified key factors influencing productivity and provided recommendations to standardize practices and improve overall performance.

---

## [Episode Complexity and Output Efficiency Analysis](https://github.com/diamond-one/Episode-Complexity-and-Output-Efficiency-Analysis)
This project explored how episode complexity affects production efficiency in animation studios. I analyzed factors like scene count and special effects to determine their impact on timelines and resources.

---

## [Analysis and Mitigation of Delays in Animation Production](https://github.com/diamond-one/Analysis-and-Mitigation-of-Delays-in-Animation-Production)
This project examines trends in animation production delays across three studios—StudioA, StudioB, and StudioC. By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to identify patterns and implement strategies, such as buffer times, to enhance scheduling accuracy and improve overall production efficiency.

---

## [Optimizing Efficiency in Animation Production](https://github.com/diamond-one/Optimizing-Efficiency-in-Animation-Production)
Analyzes efficiency in the animation production process across StudioA, StudioB, and StudioC, focusing on identifying optimal team sizes, standardizing production processes, and improving overall efficiency across blocking and spline stages.

---

## [Impact of Revisions and Feedback Loops on Animation Production](https://github.com/diamond-one/Impact-of-Revisions-and-Feedback-Loops-on-Animation-Production)
This project analyzed the impact of multiple revision rounds and feedback loops on animation production timelines and quality across various studios. By examining the frequency, timing, and reasons for revisions, we identified key patterns and best practices to streamline feedback processes, reduce unnecessary delays, and enhance overall production efficiency.

# Non Data Projects

### [ASynchronous Slack-bot](https://github.com/diamond-one/Async-Slackbot)
A Slack bot created to run every other day, enabling development teams to update each other with their progress without needing a Standup

### [Ableton Controller](https://github.com/diamond-one/Ableton_Control)
Developed MIDI controllers for seamless hardware integration with Ableton Live.

### [Hanimex E300 Super 8 Viewer Retrofit](https://github.com/diamond-one/Hanimex-E300-Retro-Computer-)
Transformed the Hanimex E300 into a modern retro-computer.

### [Czech Quest: Master 1000 Words](https://github.com/diamond-one/Czech_Quest)
A terminal-based language learning app using the Leitner system for vocabulary mastery.
