Hi, I'm Matt Diamond.

I'm a skateboarder, gamer, and electronic musician, with a deep curiosity for understanding how things work at a fundamental level. Whether it's crafting synths from scratch, studying the psychology and methods behind effective teams and leadership, analyzing data to solve complex problems, or testing and integrating efficient project pipelines, I immerse myself in the details. 

My professional journey primarily revolves around descriptive analytics and creating project management data pipelines, particularly in the gaming and TV production industries. However, I'm always striving to deepen my understanding of larger datasets and contribute to making complex data more accessible and actionable.

# My Past Projects

### [Muppet Babies Animation Production Dashboards](https://github.com/your-github-username/muppet-babies-dashboard)

**Problem Statement**: We aimed to optimize our animation processes by comparing different animation techniques and assessing the impact of notes from directors and clients on our production schedule.

**Key Insights**: 
- Evaluated whether blocking or spline techniques were faster, helping us streamline the animation process.
- Analyzed velocity comparisons between studios in Israel, Canada, and the Czech Republic.
- Investigated the correlation between internal and client notes and their impact on schedule efficiency, revealing that fewer internal notes could potentially lead to quicker client approval.

### [Jira Analytics and Dashboards for Producers](https://github.com/your-github-username/jira-analytics)

**Problem Statement**: The data collected was insufficient for Jira to parse velocity effectively. We explored alternative data points to establish a reliable team velocity metric and addressed the issue of milestone bloat as projects progressed.

**Key Insights**:
- Developed a methodology for calculating team velocity using alternative data points.
- Identified the causes of milestone bloat and proposed strategies for better task planning and management.

### Personal Interests

Outside of work, I've recently embarked on the incredible journey of fatherhood. Helping my daughter grow, learn, and experience the world has been one of the most fulfilling projects I've been a part of, even if she does most of the work! It's a joy to guide and support her as she discovers new things.
