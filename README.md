# My Past Data Projects

## [European LinkedIn Data Jobs Insights](https://github.com/diamond-one/LinkedIn-Data-Jobs-Insights)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/391dd41a-11d1-4a79-9858-c40755bba78b" style="margin-right: 15px;">

A project where I scraped and analyzed job postings across Europe to uncover key trends in the data industry. This project dives into which skills are most sought after, which roles are in demand, and where the top opportunities are located, providing a clear snapshot of the data job market landscape. Perfect for understanding the current dynamics and making informed career decisions.

## [CG TV Series Production Pipeline Optimization](https://github.com/diamond-one/CG-TV-Series-Pipeline-Optimisation/tree/main)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdef3e8e-6199-4b24-9f60-68458cf8e6cd" style="margin-right: 15px;">
In this project, I optimized the production pipeline for the CG animated TV series "Muppet Babies" by analyzing data from the lighting and rendering departments. We identified critical bottlenecks in Shading and Rigging, implemented specialized review stages, and enhanced QA processes for early issue detection.

## [Episode Complexity and Output Efficiency Analysis](https://github.com/diamond-one/Episode-Complexity-and-Output-Efficiency-Analysis)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f625115f-74b0-40e2-aedb-6fc4c6b26d9f" style="margin-right: 15px;">
This project analyzed the correlation between episode complexity and production efficiency in animation studios. I developed a system to assess factors such as scene count and special effects, determining their impact on timelines and resources. Additionally, I created a tool to provide standardized, data-driven complexity scores for each episode, helping to predict and mitigate potential production delays

## [Analysis and Mitigation of Delays in Animation Production](https://github.com/diamond-one/Analysis-and-Mitigation-of-Delays-in-Animation-Production)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ab07632-0078-40b9-ab9c-47671f9d82ac" style="margin-right: 15px;">
This project examines trends in animation production delays across three studios—StudioA, StudioB, and StudioC. By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to identify patterns and implement strategies, such as buffer times, to enhance scheduling accuracy and improve overall production efficiency.

## [Impact of Revisions and Feedback Loops on Animation Production](https://github.com/diamond-one/Impact-of-Revisions-and-Feedback-Loops-on-Animation-Production)
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0218d392-7377-4aac-864b-b1e4606dc651" style="margin-right: 15px;">
This project analyzed the impact of multiple revision rounds and feedback loops on animation production timelines and quality across various studios. By examining the frequency, timing, and reasons for revisions, we identified key patterns and best practices to streamline feedback processes, reduce unnecessary delays, and enhance overall production efficiency.
