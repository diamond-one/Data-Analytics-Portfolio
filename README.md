Hi, I'm Matt Diamond.

I'm a skateboarder, casual gamer, and electronic musician with a deep curiosity for understanding how things work at a fundamental level. Whether I'm designing synths from scratch, studying the psychology and methods of effective teams and leadership, analyzing data to solve complex problems, or testing and integrating efficient project pipelines, I immerse myself in the details.

Moreover, I enjoy uncovering stories hidden within data and helping to forecast the future direction businesses should take.

My professional journey primarily revolves around descriptive analytics, forecasting, and creating project management data pipelines, particularly in the gaming and TV production industries. However, I'm always striving to deepen my understanding of larger datasets and diverse problems, contributing to making complex data more accessible and actionable.

# Get to Know Me 

### Skills and Technologies

When working with data, I utilize tools and technologies such as Excel, Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, SQL, JQL, Power BI, Cognos, Looker Studio, Ftrack, Shotgrid, and Git. These enable me to craft robust data solutions, streamline workflows, and deliver insightful analytics.

However, I'm quick to pick up new things and always eager to expand my skill set and explore new software and technologies. I find great pleasure in staying adaptable and am committed to continuous learning.

# My Past Data Projects

## [Muppet Babies Production Pipeline Optimization](https://github.com/diamond-one/MuppetBabies-Pipeline-Optimization)

Leveraging data from our issue tracking system to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in our production pipeline. 
This analysis aimed to reduce delays, optimize workflows, and improve overall project delivery timelines.

## [Animation-Studio-Velocity-Analysis](https://github.com/diamond-one/Animation-Studio-Velocity-Analysis)

This project analyzes the animation output of three studios—StudioA, StudioB, and StudioC—working on the MBA project. The focus is on identifying disparities in output across different phases (Blocking and Spline) and providing actionable insights to optimize efficiency and standardize output across studios..

## [Episode Complexity and Output Efficiency Analysis](https://github.com/diamond-one/Episode-Complexity-and-Output-Efficiency-Analysis)

In this project, I analyzed the complexity and efficiency of the animation production pipeline for episodes of the animated series. The goal was to understand how the complexity of each episode affected production times in the Blocking and Spline phases, and to identify opportunities for optimizing workflows and resource allocation.
